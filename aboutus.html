Shanon has always been dreaming of opening a bakery since her teenage years and when the pandemic hit her dream became stronger than ever and now we have more than 100 branches all over Indonesia. </p>

                        Our logo has the meaning of a humble start. The house in the middle of the logo is a symbol of a home bakery with a hint of warmness in it indicating that it is first a home bakery and because of the overwhelming love and support from our customers, it has come to the point that it is in right now.</p>
